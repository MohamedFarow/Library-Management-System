# Library-Management-System
This file provides the full database schema and sample data to support basic operations for a library management system. It handles tracking books, borrowers, loans, and branches. The stored procedures enable easier querying and reporting on the data.
Based on the contents of the SQL file, it appears to be creating a database and tables for a library management system, and then populating the tables with sample data.

Some key points:

It creates a database called db_LibraryManagement
It creates tables for publishers, books, library branches, borrowers, book loans, book copies, and book authors. This allows tracking of books, branches, borrowers, loans, etc.
Primary keys and foreign keys are defined to link the tables. For example, book loans references books and borrowers.
Sample data is inserted into each table, with realistic looking names, addresses, and phone numbers. This provides test data to work with.
Stored procedures are created to perform common operations, like:
Getting book copies by branch
Finding borrowers with no loans
Getting overdue loans
Counting loans per branch
So in summary, it's setting up a full database structure for managing a library system, with tables, relationships, sample data, and stored procedures to query and report on that data. This provides a good foundation to build a library management application on top of.
